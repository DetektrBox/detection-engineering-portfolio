# Why This 9-Day Sprint Proves I’m Ready as a Detection Engineer

This sprint is not an intro course.  
This is **real detection engineering** — the exact competencies companies pay six figures for.

### What the 9-Day Sprint Actually Proves

1. **Multi-Sensor Telemetry Mastery** – Day 1  
   I know exactly what Sysmon, Windows, LimaCharlie, and OSQuery see (and miss) at the field level.

2. **Rule Authoring from Raw Telemetry** – Day 2  
   No copy-paste. I write high-fidelity + noisy rules with explicit FP/FN reasoning.

3. **Multi-Event Correlation** – Day 3  
   I chain process → registry → task → execution into real detection stories.

4. **SIEM Operationalization** – Day 4  
   I translate Sigma into KQL / EQL / Lucene that actually work in Kibana.

5. **Detection-as-Code Governance** – Day 5  
   CI/CD that fails the build on broken rules — the way Microsoft, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto do it internally.

6. **Structured Adversary Emulation** – Day 6  
   Caldera ATT&CK chains with telemetry + custom detections.

7. **Modern C2 Detection** – Day 7  
   Sliver beacon → injection → lateral movement → Sigma rules.

8. **Malware-to-Detection Mapping** – Day 8  
   CAPA + HybridAnalysis → behavioral indicators → new detections.

9. **Senior-Level Communication** – Day 9  
   Flagship case study with telemetry, rules, SIEM queries, tuning, playbook, and diagram — the exact deliverable I’d hand a CTO.

### How Long This Normally Takes
- Most people: **3–6 months** (slow, self-guided, constant blocks)
- With mentor + structure: **1–2 months**
- With military discipline + clean lab + zero fluff: **9 days**

I’m compressing 1–3 months of real detection engineering into 9 days because I have:
- Structure
- A battle-tested roadmap
- A working lab
- Prior SOC experience
- Zero scope creep

This is not rushed.  
This is **execution at velocity**.

When this sprint is complete, I won’t just have a portfolio — I’ll have a **fully-evidence-backed demonstration** that I can perform the Detection Engineer role on day one.
