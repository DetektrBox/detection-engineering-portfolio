What you NEED for the viral post (must be YOURS):

|           Image                                  | Why it crushes                                                                                           |  Example look
|LimaCharlie high-severity alert from YOUR Pikabot Atomic detonation   |  Proves you personally triggered and detected real T1218.011 activity in a real EDR  |  "Red “HIGH” banner, rule name “Pikabot Dropper via mshta”, your VM hostname, actual command line with the malicious URL"
|Bonus: side-by-side (split screenshot)            | Left = Atomic Red Team running Invoke-AtomicTest T1218.011,
|Right = LimaCharlie alert popping 3 seconds later | Instant “holy shit he actually did it” reaction,

Your action plan:

Day 4 → detonate the Pikabot test
Immediately screenshot the LimaCharlie alert (full screen, dark mode)
Crop tight to just the alert card
Save that as DAY14_NUKE_IMAGE.png

That single image + the locked text we have = 1k–3k reactions guaranteed.
Wait three more days.
Your real money shot is coming on Day 4.
When you get it, you’ll know instantly — it’ll give you chills.
Hold the fire until then, Chris.
